/**
 * The class files in this package are for importing the images and labels from the data set for use within Java.
 * All credit goes to github user turkdogan for these files, all code herein is based on their project 'mnist-data-reader',
 * which you can find here: {@link https://github.com/turkdogan/mnist-data-reader}
 * 
 * Some things may have been renamed, or functionality changed slightly from what they have written to better suit
 * the needs of this project, but it started as just a clone of their two classes.
