/**
 * This package is a miscellaneous utilities package, specifically containing various methods used for the purpose of
 * abstracting away the various libraries used in the project. This is done to make switching from one library to another easier
 * (for example, switching from Java's built-in Random class to a third-party psuedorandom number generator), and to create
 * methods that will be frequently used throughout the project that aren't already in the libraries we're using.
