/**
 * The class files in this package contain the code used for the following:
 * 1. The actual execution of the neural networks themselves
 * 2. The assessment of how well each neural network performs when given test data
 * This is the code that will most closely resemble that of traditional neural networks.
 * 
 * Note: an organism's performance is one, but not necessarily the only, factor in determining its fitness,
 * which is determined in the ecology package
