/**
 * The class files in this package contain the code used for the following processes:
 * 1. Evaluating the fitness of each organism, relative to the others
 * 2. Selecting which organisms survive, based on their fitness
 * 3. Repopulating by mating surviving organisms to create progeny, until the population is back up to size.
 * 
 * This package is also where the "main" method is placed, and the numerical parameters of the simulation are specified.
